# MasterAssister
The purpose of this tool is to aid Exalted 2nd Edition masters to orchestrate their campaigns.
Currently the only feature that this tool provides is "charm-retrivial", but it will be extended to cover more aspects.

# Prerequisites:
This project uses python3.* (recommended 3.7), so the latter is mandatory to execute the program.
